# Plant Manager

This is just a study project to improve my react native skills.

I tried to use some tools to improve dev experience:

- Typescript
- Expo
- ESLint
- Prettier
- Jest
- React Testing Library

But there a lot of improvements I still want to try out, e.g:

- Storybook
- Experiment with different state management libraries (MobX, XState, Zustand)
- Organize files and folders
- Add new screens and functionality
